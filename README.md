# Community Management

During the execution of the experimentation process it is often required to establish engaging  mechanisms to promote the use of experiments in an intensive way. With this aim the Community Management tool is created, which enables the experimenter to populate its experiments among OrganiCity users whose profiles are related to the experiment objectives, so that a community can be defined for each experiment.
