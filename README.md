# Community Management

During the execution of the experimentation process it is often required to establish engaging  mechanisms to promote the use of experiments in an intensive way. With this aim the Community Management tool is created, which enables the experimenter to populate its experiments among OrganiCity users whose profiles are related to the experiment objectives, so that a community can be defined for each experiment.

You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test the Web App. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

Also gulp: `npm install -g gulp` (with `sudo` if you are using Mac).
